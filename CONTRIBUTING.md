# Contributing to ASN1 Play !!!

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project. Please take a moment to review this document in order to make
the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this
open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.

## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports),
[features requests](#feature-requests) and submitting [pull requests](#pull-requests), but please
respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use
  [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)).

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

For any questions, support, or ideas, etc. 
[please create a GitHub discussion](https://github.com/impratikjaiswal/asn1Play/discussions/new/choose).

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

If you've noticed a bug, [please submit an issue](https://github.com/impratikjaiswal/asn1Play/issues/new).

## Bug Reports Guidelines

1. **Use the GitHub issue search.** Check if the issue has already been
   [reported](https://github.com/impratikjaiswal/asn1Play/issues).

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed.** Try to reproduce it using the
   latest `main` or `dev` branch in the repository.

3. **Provide environment details.** Provide your operating system, browser(s),
   python version, project version and other details.

4. **Include supporting references (if any).** 

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS
experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these
details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Pull requests

**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new
feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create
[a feature request](https://github.com/impratikjaiswal/asn1Play/discussions/new?category=ideas) to first discuss any 
new ideas. Your ideas and suggestions are welcome!

Please ensure that the tests are passing when submitting a pull request. 
If you're adding new features to this project, please include tests.

## Pull Request Guidelines

You must understand that by contributing code to this project, you are granting
the authors (and/or leaders) of the project a non-exclusive license to
re-distribute your code under the current license and possibly re-license the
code as deemed necessary.

If this is something you think you can fix, then [fork](https://github.com/impratikjaiswal/asn1Play/fork) and create
a branch with a descriptive name.

* IMPORTANT: base your PR on the `dev` branch and target the `dev` branch
* Please check to make sure that there aren't existing pull requests attempting
  to address the issue mentioned. We also recommend checking for issues related
  to the issue on the tracker, as a team member may be working on the issue in
  a branch or fork.
* Non-trivial changes should be discussed in an issue first
* When modifying files, please do not edit the generated or minified files in the dist/ directory. Please edit the original files.
* If possible, add relevant tests to cover the change
* Write a convincing description of your PR and why we should land it
